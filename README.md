# Plant-care
This project presents a deep learning-based web application designed to assist farmers and agricultural researchers in the rapid identification of plant diseases from leaf images. Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system detects multiple diseases across a variety of crops including tomatoes, potatoes, grapes, more.
